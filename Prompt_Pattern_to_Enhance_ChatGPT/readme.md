# Prompt Engineering: Enhancing Interactions with Large Language Models

This repository contains the code and resources related to the concept of "prompt engineering," a method for effectively interacting with large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. The research paper titled "Prompt Engineering: A Catalog of Patterns for Structuring Interactions with Large Language Models" serves as the foundation for this work.

## About the Paper

The paper explores the concept of prompt engineering and presents a catalog of techniques in the form of patterns. These patterns are reusable solutions that address common challenges encountered when interacting with LLMs. The authors identify three key contributions of the paper:

1. **Framework for Prompt Documentation**: The paper provides a structured framework for documenting patterns used to structure prompts. This enables the recording and description of various prompt creation methods that can be adapted to different domains. This approach promotes the reuse of successful prompt strategies in different contexts.

2. **Catalog of Effective Patterns**: A comprehensive catalog of patterns is presented, showcasing techniques that have been successfully employed to enhance the outputs of LLM conversations. This collection offers specific methods that have proven to enhance the quality of interactions with LLMs.

3. **Pattern Combination for Better Results**: The paper explains how prompts can be constructed by combining multiple patterns. It highlights the benefits of leveraging the synergies between different prompt strategies rather than relying solely on a single approach. By combining patterns, users can achieve even more robust and effective results in their interactions with LLMs.

## Summary in Layman's Terms

In simpler terms, this research paper focuses on maximizing the potential of conversational AI models like ChatGPT. It provides a collection of strategies, referred to as patterns, for structuring prompts to generate the best possible responses. These patterns address common challenges encountered when interacting with AI models. By following these strategies and combining them intelligently, users can greatly improve the quality and effectiveness of their conversations with AI models.
